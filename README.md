# UserHub

This app is designed to display user details fetched from an API.

Current Features:
1. Search Bar: Allows users to search by name, showing matching user cards.
2. User Details: Clicking on a card reveals detailed information about the selected user.
3. Add New User: Includes a form for adding new users. Note that this feature is currently non-functional due to the API lacking POST request support, but it demonstrates the intended functionality.

   
Planned Enhancements:
Connectivity Check: Integrate the connectivity_plus package to check Wi-Fi status before making API calls. This could enable the app to show a Snackbar with connectivity status feedback.
